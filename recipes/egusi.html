   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>Egusi is a west African staple soup rich in fat, protein, and essential nutrients. It is particularly common in Nigeria because of its delicious match with pounded yam. The melon seed, which is the main ingredient, is derived from the melon plant in the same family as squash and gourds. <br> It is an exotic hearty food that will satisfy your taste buds. It is a staple in most West African homes, and it is an uncomplicated one-pot meal that is often accompanied by swallows like Fresh garri (Eba), Amala, Semovita, Pounded yam, Fufu, and the likes. Some hardcore like I am will even serve over Rice.</p>
   <h1>Ingredients</h1>
   <ul>
      <li>Egusi melon</li>
      <li>Palm Oil</li>
      <li>Beef, dried fish, and Crayfish</li>
      <li>Locust beans</li>

   <h1>Procedure</h1>
   <ol>
      <li>Blend the peppers and onions together</li>
      <li>Blend the Egusi melon.</li>
      <li>Heat the palm oil but don’t overheat.</li>
      <li>Add onions and locust bean.</li>
      <li>Add the blended pepper</li>
      <li>Add the remaining locust bean, beef stock, and salt to taste. Cover and leave to cook for another 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Gently introduce the blended egusi inside the sauce but don’t stir it at this point. Just cover it and leave it to cook for about 20 to 30 minutes.

      <li>Add the fish and meat and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in the spinach and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes (stir constantly). Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
