   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>African  salad (Abacha food) is a delicious west African food that is native to the ndi Igbo (people of Igbo). I can prepare this delicacy within 15 minutes and it requires just  cassava flakes, palm oil, crayfish, ugba and some other spices. <br>Abacha is very popular in the eastern part of Nigeria; it is one of the most Popular Igbo Foods; I donâ€™t visit Eastern part of the country and come back without having a taste of this Nigerian delicacy.</p>

   <h1>Procedures</h1>
   <ol>
      <li>Blend your crayfish and also slice the onions, garden  egg leaves.</li>
      <li>It is advisable to dissolve the powdered potash in about half a cup of clean water; this is a trick I employ just filter out unwanted solid materials that are often embedded in potash.</li>
      <li>Filter the dissolved potash into a mortar or pot, leaving out the residue.</li>
      <li>Add about 100ml of palm oil and stir to form a yellowish paste (ncha, as addressed by the igbos).</li>
      <li>Then add the ground crayfish and pepper, stir, then add the ground ehu if you like.</li>
      <li>Add the ugba to the mixture and stir, and then add the abacha, salt.</li>
